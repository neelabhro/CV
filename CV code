\section{Projects}
\begin{tabular}{r|p{11cm}}
 \emph & A MultiPurpose Drone\\\textsc{January 2017-Present}&\\&\footnotesize{The prototype would be devised such that it could be used to deliver (Air-Drop) relief packages and provide support materials such as First-Aid and Food, in places of calamities and disasters, and also aid the Army in its rescue operations thereby.

A second use which we plan to implement is that, it be used for detecting garbage dumps, which comes to existence with the help of a camera mounted on it which will be monitored by a ground technician who'll be saving the precise GPS co-ordinates which he'll be receiving from the UAV.This will use a RaspBerryPi and Real-Time Video capturing.

In the same way, it could be used to zero down on the locations of broken roads which is a huge problem in our country.
The above UAVs could be made available to municipalities for an efficient maintenance of the cities.}\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\

 \textsc{August 2016-Present} & Intelligent Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) \\&\footnotesize{A fixed-wing aircraft which could do a complete autonomous flight. Had 3 onboard cameras and a cloverleaf antenna. The plane could autodetect the targets lying on the ground, decode a QR code lying on the ground and also avoid virtual obstacles in air.
}\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\

 \textsc{November 2016} & RC Plane to monitor variation in Air Quality with change in Altitude.\\&\footnotesize{Designed a Totally Self made 14 channel Remote Controlled Aeroplane to monitor variation of air quality with change in Altitude using an Arduino, DHT 22. MQ 135 and other sensors.

}\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
 \textsc{October 2016} & Device for monitoring change in Climatic Conditions\\&\footnotesize{Made a device to Monitor the Changes in Climatic Conditions with respect to Sunlight, CO2 levels, Humidity etc. using Arduino, DHT 11 , MQ 135.
A low cost device which could be made available to farmers for facilitating efficient Agriculture.}\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
